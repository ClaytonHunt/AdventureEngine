Load this skill when evaluating, scoping, or breaking down work before planning begins.\n---\n\n# MVP Scoping & Incremental Delivery\n\n## The Core Problem This Solves\nLarge scopes produce large plans. Large plans produce large implementations. Large implementations produce large amounts of rework when requirements shift — and they always shift. The goal of scoping is to find the **smallest deliverable unit that produces real value and real learning**, then stop there.\n\n---\n\n## The MVP Principle\n\n**Minimum Viable Product** is not \"the smallest thing we can ship without embarrassment.\" It is:\n\n> The smallest implementation that delivers a complete, testable, valuable outcome — and allows us to learn whether we built the right thing.\n\n### MVP is NOT\n- A prototype or throwaway spike\n- A feature-incomplete version of the full vision\n- \"Let's just do the backend first\"\n- Everything in the spec but done faster\n\n### MVP IS\n- A **vertical slice**: works end-to-end through all layers\n- **Shippable**: production-quality code, tests, no shortcuts\n- **Learnable**: reveals whether the approach is correct\n- **Bounded**: one user goal, one workflow, one outcome\n\n---\n\n## Vertical Slices vs Horizontal Layers\n\n### ❌ Horizontal (layer-by-layer) — avoid\n```\nSprint 1: Design all database schemas\nSprint 2: Build all API endpoints\nSprint 3: Build all UI components\nSprint 4: Wire everything together\n```\n**Problem**: Nothing works end-to-end until the very end. Rework in sprint 1 cascades to all later sprints.\n\n### ✅ Vertical (feature-by-feature) — prefer\n```\nSprint 1: User can log in with email/password (all layers)\nSprint 2: User can reset their password (all layers)\nSprint 3: User can log in with Google OAuth (all layers)\n```\n**Why**: Each slice is independently shippable and testable. Rework is contained to one slice.\n\n---\n\n## INVEST Criteria for a Well-Scoped Increment\n\nEach unit of work should be:\n\n| Letter | Criterion | Question to ask |\n|--------|-----------|-----------------|\n| **I** | Independent | Can this be built without another piece being done first? |\n| **N** | Negotiable | Can scope be adjusted without losing the core value? |\n| **V** | Valuable | Does a real user or system benefit when this is done? |\n| **E** | Estimable | Can we predict roughly how long this will take? |\n| **S** | Small | Can this be completed in one focused session or sprint? |\n| **T** | Testable | Can we write a concrete acceptance test for it? |\n\nIf any criterion is \"no,\" the scope needs adjustment.\n\n---\n\n## Size Heuristics\n\n### A scope is **too large** if it:\n- Touches more than 3–4 distinct areas of the codebase\n- Requires more than one new data model or schema migration\n- Involves building infrastructure AND features at the same time\n- Has more than 5–6 acceptance criteria\n- Would take more than 2 days of focused implementation\n- Requires decisions from multiple teams or stakeholders\n- Contains phrases like \"and also,\" \"plus,\" \"as well as,\" \"while we're at it\"\n- Cannot be described in a single sentence ending with a concrete user outcome\n\n### A scope is **well-sized** if it:\n- Can be summarized as: \"A [user] can [do one thing] by [one interaction]\"\n- Touches one or two logical modules\n- Has 2–4 acceptance criteria\n- Requires no more than one new entity or one schema change\n- Could realistically be reviewed, tested, and merged in a single session\n\n### A scope is **too small** if it:\n- Doesn't produce any user-visible or system-observable outcome\n- Is purely internal (e.g., \"rename some variables\") — unless this is a dedicated refactor session\n- Cannot be tested against real behavior\n\n---\n\n## The Walking Skeleton\n\nFor **new features or systems**, always start with a Walking Skeleton:\n\n> A tiny, end-to-end implementation of the system that performs a small number of the required functions. It should link together the main architectural components and prove the seams between layers work.\n\n### Example\nFeature request: \"Build a notification system that emails users when their order ships\"\n\n**Walking Skeleton (first increment):**\n- Hardcoded trigger (no real event system)\n- One email template (no dynamic content)\n- No preferences, no unsubscribe, no logging\n- Just: trigger → email sent → verifiable in test\n\n**What it proves:** The email provider is integrated, the email renders, the trigger mechanism works.\n**What it defers:** Event system, preferences, unsubscribe, templates, retry logic.\n\n---\n\n## Scope Breakdown Patterns\n\n### \"Thin First\" Pattern\nBuild the thinnest version of the complete feature, then fatten it:\n```\nIncrement 1: User can submit a form and see a success message (no validation)\nIncrement 2: Add field validation and error display\nIncrement 3: Add server-side validation and error codes\nIncrement 4: Add rate limiting and abuse protection\n```\n\n### \"Happy Path First\" Pattern\nBuild only the success path. Defer error handling, edge cases, and unusual inputs:\n```\nIncrement 1: User can upload an image — happy path only\nIncrement 2: Reject invalid file types with clear error\nIncrement 3: Handle oversized files, network failures, partial uploads\n```\n\n### \"One Actor First\" Pattern\nFor multi-role systems, implement for one role completely before adding others:\n```\nIncrement 1: Admin can manage products (full CRUD)\nIncrement 2: Editor can view and edit (but not delete) products\nIncrement 3: Viewer can browse products (read only)\n```\n\n### \"Core Flow First\" Pattern\nFor complex workflows, implement the primary flow without branching:\n```\nIncrement 1: Standard checkout — card payment, in-stock items, domestic shipping\nIncrement 2: Add out-of-stock handling and backorder\nIncrement 3: Add international shipping and tax calculation\nIncrement 4: Add PayPal and alternative payment methods\n```\n\n---\n\n## What to Explicitly Defer\n\nWhen defining an increment, the **deferred list is as important as the in-scope list.** Be explicit about:\n\n- Edge cases that are real but not blocking value delivery\n- Secondary user roles or access levels\n- Optional UX enhancements (animations, advanced filters, sorting)\n- Observability and monitoring (add after happy path works)\n- Performance optimization (measure first, optimize when you have data)\n- Admin tooling (add after core feature proves itself)\n- Internationalization and localization\n- Mobile-specific behavior (if desktop works first)\n\n---\n\n## Acceptance Criteria Format\n\nEach increment must have concrete, testable acceptance criteria:\n\n```\nGiven [starting condition]\nWhen [user action or system event]\nThen [observable outcome]\n```\n\n### Examples\n```\nGiven a registered user\nWhen they submit the login form with correct credentials\nThen they are redirected to the dashboard and see their name in the header\n\nGiven a registered user\nWhen they submit the login form with incorrect credentials\nThen they see \"Invalid email or password\" and remain on the login page\n```\n\nAvoid vague criteria like \"the login works\" or \"it's fast\" — these cannot be tested.\n\n---\n\n## Scope Creep Signals\n\nWatch for these in a requirements description and flag them:\n\n| Signal | Example |\n|--------|---------|\n| \"While we're at it...\" | \"Add the search and while we're at it, add filters\" |\n| \"Also...\" | \"Build the form, also add CSV export\" |\n| \"And eventually...\" | \"Users can submit feedback and eventually we'll add sentiment analysis\" |\n| \"Make it flexible for...\" | \"Build the config screen, make it flexible for all future settings\" |\n| \"Full [X]\" | \"Build the full notification system\" |\n| \"Proper [X]\" | \"Do proper authentication\" |\n| \"Real [X]\" | \"Add a real caching layer\" |\n\nEach of these is a signal to split into separate increments.\n\n---\n\n## Definition of Done for a Single Increment\n\nAn increment is complete when:\n- [ ] All acceptance criteria pass\n- [ ] Unit tests written and passing\n- [ ] No regressions in existing tests\n- [ ] Code reviewed (or self-reviewed against reviewer checklist)\n- [ ] Deployed to at least one environment beyond local\n- [ ] The next increment is defined (even if not started)\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771889371556}}

Sprint Header\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| **Sprint number** | 1 |\n| **Dates** | Day 1 – Day 10 (2-week sprint) |\n| **Capacity (raw)** | 8 story points |\n| **Capacity (effective)** | 6 story points (8 × 0.75 focus factor) |\n| **Team size** | 1–2 developers |\n| **Sprint status** | 🟢 Planned — items locked and ready |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Sprint Goal\n\n> **Establish the foundational monorepo skeleton, SharedKernel DDD primitives, and .NET Aspire orchestration layer so that every subsequent item has a stable, correctly-placed home and the walking skeleton is ready to receive the API and React frontend.**\n\nAt the end of Sprint 1, a developer can clone the repository, run `pnpm install`, and launch the Aspire dashboard — confirming the toolchain is wired and the project structure is locked in place.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Decision Log\n\nAll 5 architectural decisions were resolved and locked into `backlog.json` during the pre-sprint backlog review. No open decisions remain.\n\n| # | Question | Decision | Rationale | Items Updated |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Folder convention: `apps/` vs `src/` | **`apps/`** | Monorepo-conventional (pnpm workspaces, Turborepo/Nx style). `apps/` = runnable projects; `packages/` = shared libraries. Avoids tooling confusion when workspace scanning. | item-001, item-006, item-009 |\n| 2 | OpenAPI tooling: Built-in .NET 9 vs Swashbuckle | **Built-in .NET 9 OpenAPI + Scalar UI** | Zero extra packages; `AddOpenApi()` / `MapOpenApi()` / `MapScalarApiReference()` is the idiomatic .NET 9 pattern. Microsoft's own templates no longer include Swashbuckle for .NET 9+. | item-004 |\n| 3 | Playwright placement: `apps/web/e2e/` vs standalone `e2e/` | **`apps/web/e2e/`** | Co-located with the app it tests; single `playwright.config.ts` scoped to the web app; simplest setup for a single frontend. Can be extracted to a standalone workspace package later if multi-app e2e is needed. | item-009, item-013 |\n| 4 | Docker Compose scope: Include or defer? | **Include** | Reduces onboarding friction for contributors who cannot or prefer not to install the Aspire workload. Valuable for an open-source or multi-contributor project. Adds ~2pt to a later sprint — acceptable. | item-012, item-013 |\n| 5 | Dev cert documentation: README only vs item-003 AC + README | **Option B — both** | Adding the `dotnet dev-certs https --trust` requirement as an explicit AC in item-003 ensures the developer implementing Aspire verifies it works on their machine. The README prerequisite (item-013) then picks it up automatically. | item-003, item-013 |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Selected Items\n\n> **Total: 3 items · 6 story points · exactly at effective capacity**\n\n---\n\n### item-001 — Scaffold monorepo folder structure + root `package.json`\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| **Points** | 2 |\n| **Priority** | 1 (highest — must be done first) |\n| **Status** | `in-sprint` |\n| **Tags** | `monorepo`, `scaffold`, `chore` |\n| **Dependencies** | None |\n\n**Description:**\nCreate the top-level monorepo skeleton: root `package.json` with pnpm workspaces, workspace scripts (`start`, `test`, `test:e2e`, `test:api`, `storybook`, `build`), `.gitignore`, `.nvmrc` / `.node-version`, and the agreed top-level directory structure.\n\n**Folder structure (Decision 1 locked):**\n```\napps/\n  web/          ← React + Vite frontend\n  Api/          ← ASP.NET Core Web API\n  AppHost/      ← .NET Aspire orchestration host\npackages/\n  SharedKernel/ ← C# DDD base types\n  ServiceDefaults/ ← Aspire telemetry defaults\n```\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] Root `package.json` exists with `\"name\"`, `\"private\": true`, `\"packageManager\": \"pnpm@<version>\"`, a `\"workspaces\"` field listing `[\"apps/*\", \"packages/*\"]`, and placeholder scripts: `start`, `test`, `test:e2e`, `test:api`, `storybook`, `build`.\n- [ ] `pnpm-workspace.yaml` lists all workspace globs (e.g. `apps/*`, `packages/*`).\n- [ ] `.gitignore` covers `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.env`, `.env.local`, `bin/obj/`, `.aspire/`, `.playwright/`.\n- [ ] Running `pnpm install` at the repo root completes without errors and generates `pnpm-lock.yaml`.\n- [ ] Top-level directory tree matches the agreed `apps/` convention with `apps/` for runnable projects and `packages/` for shared libraries.\n- [ ] A `CONTRIBUTING.md` stub or inline comment in the root `package.json` documents the chosen folder convention.\n\n---\n\n### item-002 — Create SharedKernel C# class library with DDD building blocks\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| **Points** | 2 |\n| **Priority** | 2 |\n| **Status** | `in-sprint` |\n| **Tags** | `backend`, `dotnet`, `architecture`, `ddd` |\n| **Dependencies** | item-001 ✅ (in this sprint) |\n\n**Description:**\nAdd a `SharedKernel` C# class library project under `packages/SharedKernel/`. Implement the abstract base classes and interfaces used across all vertical slices: `Entity<TId>`, `ValueObject`, `AggregateRoot<TId>`, `DomainEvent`, `IRepository<T, TId>`, `Result<T>`, and `Error`. No business logic — only structural contracts and DDD building blocks.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] `SharedKernel.csproj` exists as a class library targeting the same TFM as the API project (e.g. `net9.0`).\n- [ ] The following types exist and compile: `Entity<TId>` (identity-based equality), `ValueObject` (equality by components), `AggregateRoot<TId>` (extends `Entity`, holds `IReadOnlyList<DomainEvent>`), `DomainEvent` (abstract record), `IRepository<T, TId>` (Find, Add, Update, Remove), `Result<T>` (success/failure union with `IsSuccess`, `Value`, `Error`), `Error` (record with `Code` + `Message`).\n- [ ] All types have XML doc comments summarising their intent.\n- [ ] `dotnet build` on the SharedKernel project produces zero warnings and zero errors.\n- [ ] SharedKernel has no dependencies on any other project in the solution — no EF Core, no HTTP clients.\n- [ ] At least one xUnit unit test validates `Result<T>` success/failure behaviour (can live in item-014's test project, written when that item is picked up).\n\n---\n\n### item-003 — Set up .NET Aspire AppHost and ServiceDefaults\n\n| Field | Value |\n|---|---|\n| **Points** | 2 |\n| **Priority** | 3 |\n| **Status** | `in-sprint` |\n| **Tags** | `backend`, `dotnet`, `aspire`, `infrastructure` |\n| **Dependencies** | item-001 ✅ (in this sprint) |\n\n**Description:**\nAdd the .NET Aspire `AppHost` project (`apps/AppHost/`) and the `ServiceDefaults` project (`packages/ServiceDefaults/`) to the solution. `ServiceDefaults` adds OpenTelemetry, health check endpoints, and resilience defaults via extension methods. `AppHost` references the API project stub and wires up local dev orchestration.\n\n> ⚠️ **Dev certificate prerequisite (Decision 5 locked):** The developer implementing this item **must** run `dotnet dev-certs https --trust` on their machine and confirm the Aspire dashboard loads without browser HTTPS errors before marking this item done.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- [ ] `AppHost.csproj` and `ServiceDefaults.csproj` exist and are added to the `.sln` file.\n- [ ] Running `dotnet run --project apps/AppHost` launches the Aspire dashboard (default `http://localhost:15888`) without errors.\n- [ ] `ServiceDefaults` project exposes `AddServiceDefaults()` and `MapDefaultEndpoints()` extension methods that configure OpenTelemetry tracing, metrics, and health checks.\n- [ ] `AppHost` references the API project via `AddProject<>()` (the API does not need to be fully implemented — a placeholder `Program.cs` is acceptable).\n- [ ] `dotnet build` on the full solution produces zero errors.\n- [ ] README note (or inline comment in the AppHost `Program.cs`) documents the `dotnet dev-certs https --trust` prerequisite — and the developer implementing this item verifies the command works on their machine as part of completing this item.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Execution Order and Parallelism\n\n```\nDay 1–2\n└── [Both devs] item-001 — Scaffold monorepo root\n        ↓ MERGE — this is a hard gate; nothing else starts until this is on main\n\nDay 2–10  (run in parallel once item-001 is merged)\n├── [Dev A] item-002 — SharedKernel DDD building blocks\n└── [Dev B] item-003 — Aspire AppHost + ServiceDefaults\n```\n\n> **Rule:** item-001 must be merged to `main` before item-002 or item-003 branches are cut. Attempting to parallelise item-001 alongside item-002/003 risks structural merge conflicts in the `.sln` file and root configuration files.\n\n**Why this ordering works:**\n- item-002 and item-003 both depend on item-001, but they are independent of each other.\n- After item-001 merges, both items can be worked simultaneously with no risk of cross-conflict (item-002 touches `packages/SharedKernel/`; item-003 touches `apps/AppHost/` and `packages/ServiceDefaults/`).\n- Both items complete before Day 10, leaving Sprint 2 fully unblocked.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Definition of Done\n\nThe following checklist applies to **every item** in this sprint. An item is not done until all boxes are checked.\n\n**Code quality**\n- [ ] Code compiles with zero errors and zero warnings (`dotnet build` / `pnpm tsc --noEmit`)\n- [ ] No commented-out dead code committed to main\n- [ ] All public types/functions/methods have doc comments\n\n**Testing**\n- [ ] All acceptance criteria from the item are verifiable (manual check or automated test)\n- [ ] No regressions in the existing test suite\n\n**Review**\n- [ ] Code has been reviewed by at least one other team member (or self-reviewed with a checklist for solo developers)\n- [ ] PR description references the item ID (e.g. `Closes item-003`)\n- [ ] Branch is merged to `main` and the working branch is deleted\n\n**Backlog hygiene**\n- [ ] Item `status` is updated to `\"done\"` in `backlog.json`\n- [ ] Any new decisions or deviations are recorded in the item's description\n\n**Sprint goal**\n- [ ] At sprint end: a developer can clone the repo, run `pnpm install`, and launch the .NET Aspire dashboard without error\n\n---\n\n## 7. Prerequisites — Machine Setup\n\nEvery developer must have completed the following **before Sprint 1 Day 1**. These are one-time setup steps, not part of any backlog item.\n\n```bash\n# 1. Node.js — install the LTS version pinned in .nvmrc\n#    Recommended: use nvm (macOS/Linux) or nvm-windows\nnvm install --lts\nnvm use --lts\n\n# 2. pnpm — fast, disk-efficient package manager required by this monorepo\nnpm install -g pnpm\n\n# 3. .NET 9 SDK\n#    Download from: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0\n\n# 4. .NET Aspire workload — required for item-003\ndotnet workload install aspire\n\n# 5. Trust the local HTTPS dev certificate — required for Aspire dashboard\n#    Run ONCE per machine. Skip this and the Aspire dashboard will fail on HTTPS.\ndotnet dev-certs https --trust\n\n# 6. Docker Desktop (optional — required for item-012 in a later sprint)\n#    Download from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop\n```\n\n> **Why `dotnet dev-certs https --trust`?** .NET Aspire uses HTTPS by default. Without a trusted local certificate, the browser will reject the Aspire dashboard and all API HTTPS calls. This is a one-time operation per developer machine.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Full Backlog Roadmap\n\nAll 16 items across projected sprints. Sprint assignments assume **6 effective story points per sprint** (single developer baseline; parallelise for a two-developer team).\n\n| ID | Title | Pts | Status | Tags | Sprint |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| item-001 | Scaffold monorepo folder structure + root `package.json` | 2 | `in-sprint` | monorepo, scaffold | **S1** |\n| item-002 | Create SharedKernel C# class library with DDD building blocks | 2 | `in-sprint` | backend, dotnet, ddd | **S1** |\n| item-003 | Set up .NET Aspire AppHost and ServiceDefaults | 2 | `in-sprint` | backend, dotnet, aspire | **S1** |\n| item-014 | Scaffold backend xUnit test projects and wire to solution | 2 | `pending` | backend, testing, xunit | **S2** |\n| item-004 | Scaffold ASP.NET Core Web API wired to Aspire with OpenAPI | 2 | `pending` | backend, api, openapi | **S2** |\n| item-006 | Scaffold React Vite app with TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier | 2 | `pending` | frontend, react, vite | **S2** |\n| item-005 | Health Check vertical slice with unit + integration tests | 3 | `pending` | backend, vsa, testing | **S3** |\n| item-007 | Configure Vitest + React Testing Library with example test | 2 | `pending` | frontend, testing, vitest | **S3** |\n| item-008 | Set up Storybook with baseline Button component + story | 2 | `pending` | frontend, storybook, ux | **S3** |\n| item-009 | Configure Playwright e2e suite with one smoke test | 2 | `pending` | frontend, e2e, playwright | **S4** |\n| item-015 | Configure CORS policy for React dev server ↔ ASP.NET API | 1 | `pending` | backend, cors, frontend | **S4** |\n| item-010 | Wire root orchestration scripts for single-command start + test | 2 | `pending` | dx, scripts, monorepo | **S4** |\n| item-011 | Add `.env.example` with all environment variables documented | 1 | `pending` | dx, config, environment | **S5** |\n| item-012 | Add Docker Compose alternative local start | 2 | `pending` | devops, docker, optional | **S5** |\n| item-016 | GitHub Actions CI pipeline (test + build on PR) | 2 | `pending` | ci, devops, github-actions | **S5** |\n| item-013 | Write README with Getting Started + dev commands | 1 | `pending` | documentation, dx, readme | **S5** |\n\n**Totals:**\n\n| Sprint | Items | Points | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| S1 | 3 | 6 | Monorepo foundation + .NET skeleton |\n| S2 | 3 | 6 | Test harness, API scaffold, React scaffold |\n| S3 | 3 | 7 | First vertical slice + frontend test tooling *(7pt — consider splitting if needed)* |\n| S4 | 3 | 5 | e2e, CORS, orchestration scripts |\n| S5 | 4 | 6 | Env config, Docker, CI pipeline, README |\n| **Total** | **16** | **30pt** | ~5 sprints at 6pt/sprint |\n\n---\n\n## 9. Sprint 2 Preview\n\nSprint 2 is **fully unblocked** the moment Sprint 1 closes. No additional decisions or prerequisites are required.\n\n| Item | Title | Points | Why it's next |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| item-014 | Scaffold backend xUnit test projects | 2 | Unlocked by item-002 + item-003; sets up the test harness before any real feature work |\n| item-004 | Scaffold ASP.NET Core Web API with Aspire + OpenAPI | 2 | Unlocked by item-002 + item-003; uses built-in .NET 9 OpenAPI + Scalar UI (Decision 2) |\n| item-006 | Scaffold React Vite app with TypeScript + ESLint + Prettier | 2 | Unlocked by item-001; lives at `apps/web/` (Decision 1); independent of backend track |\n\n**Sprint 2 goal (preview):** Wire the backend test harness, stand up the API with a live OpenAPI document, and create the React app scaffold — so that both tracks have runnable, testable starting points for feature work.\n\n**Execution note for Sprint 2:** item-014 and item-004 share dependencies (item-002, item-003) but are otherwise independent. item-006 depends only on item-001 and is fully independent of the backend track. All three can be parallelised across two developers after item-014 is started.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Risks and Mitigations\n\n| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | **item-001 takes longer than Day 2**, blocking item-002 and item-003 from starting and compressing the remaining sprint | Medium | High | Timebox item-001 strictly to Day 1–2. The scaffold is intentionally minimal — no actual code, only configuration files and empty directories. If it's not done by end of Day 2, descope to the bare minimum needed to unblock the other two items (root `package.json` + folder structure). |\n| 2 | **Aspire workload not installed** on the developer machine taking item-003, causing a 15–30 minute unplanned setup delay mid-sprint | Medium | Medium | Enforce the machine setup checklist (Section 7) before Day 1. The developer taking item-003 should run `dotnet workload install aspire` and `dotnet dev-certs https --trust` the day before the sprint starts and confirm success. |\n| 3 | **`.sln` merge conflict** if item-002 and item-003 are both adding projects to the solution file simultaneously | Low | Medium | item-001 should create the `.sln` stub. item-002 and item-003 add their projects to it via separate PRs. If both PRs are open simultaneously, the second PR to merge must rebase and re-add its project reference after the first merges. Use short-lived branches and merge item-002 before item-003 (or vice versa) to minimise conflict window. |\n\n---\n\n*Sprint plan generated at end of sprint planning session — 2026-02-23.*\n*Authoritative item data lives in `backlog.json`.

Executive Summary\n\nThis grooming session decomposed the raw requirements for a brand-new full-stack web application into a fully prioritised, dependency-mapped backlog.\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|---|---|\n| Total backlog items | **16** |\n| Total story points | **~31** |\n| Largest single item | 3 pts (item-005) |\n| Items at or under 2 pts | 15 of 16 |\n| Items status | All `ready` |\n| Parallel tracks available | Yes — backend + frontend after item-001 |\n\nTwo grooming passes were completed:\n\n1. **Ingestion pass** — 13 items written (25 pts), two parallel tracks identified (backend items 001–005, frontend items 006–009).\n2. **Health-review pass** — 3 new items added (item-014 xUnit scaffold, item-015 CORS, item-016 CI pipeline); acceptance criteria tightened across 6 items; dependency graph corrected; tags normalised. Final count: 16 items, ~31 pts.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Sprint Planning Suggestions\n\n> Assumed team velocity: **6 story points per sprint** (single developer).\n> Adjust sprints proportionally for a two-person team (see note below).\n\n### Single-developer plan (6 pts / sprint)\n\n| Sprint | Items | Points | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Sprint 1** | item-001, item-002, item-003 | 6 | Foundation — monorepo + .NET skeleton |\n| **Sprint 2** | item-014, item-004, item-006 | 6 | Test harness, API, React scaffold |\n| **Sprint 3** | item-005, item-007, item-008 | 7 | First slice + frontend test tooling *(consider pulling item-007 to Sprint 2 if capacity allows)* |\n| **Sprint 4** | item-009, item-015, item-010 | 5 | e2e, CORS, orchestration |\n| **Sprint 5** | item-011, item-012, item-016, item-013 | 6 | Env config, Docker, CI, README |\n\n**Total: 5 sprints, ~30 working days at 2 weeks/sprint.**\n\n### Two-developer plan (parallelised)\n\n| Sprint | Developer A (Backend) | Developer B (Frontend) | Combined pts |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Sprint 1** | item-001 (shared) | — | 2 |\n| **Sprint 2** | item-002, item-003 (4) | item-006, item-007 (4) | 8 |\n| **Sprint 3** | item-014, item-004 (4) | item-008, item-009 (4) | 8 |\n| **Sprint 4** | item-005 (3) | item-015 (1) | 4 |\n| **Sprint 5** | item-010, item-016 (4) | item-011, item-012, item-013 (4) | 8 |\n\n**Total: 5 sprints collapses to ~3 sprints of meaningful parallel work.**\n\n---\n\n## 5. Pre-Sprint Decisions Required\n\nThe following decisions **must be made before the first ticket is picked up**. Recommended defaults are provided — confirm or override before sprint planning.\n\n### Decision 1 — Folder convention: `apps/` vs `src/`\n\n| Option | Description | Recommendation |\n|---|---|---|\n| `apps/web/` | Standard monorepo convention; room for `apps/api/` later | ✅ **Recommended** |\n| `src/web/` | Simpler for small projects | Only if no plans for additional apps |\n\n**Affects:** item-001, item-006, item-009.\n**Action:** Agree and note in item-001's description before pickup.\n\n---\n\n### Decision 2 — OpenAPI tooling: Built-in .NET 9 vs Swashbuckle\n\n| Option | Description | Recommendation |\n|---|---|---|\n| Built-in .NET 9 `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` | Zero extra packages, supported by Microsoft | ✅ **Recommended** for .NET 9+ |\n| Swashbuckle.AspNetCore | Mature, widely documented, richer UI | Choose if team is familiar |\n\n**Affects:** item-004.\n**Action:** Add the chosen NuGet package reference to item-004's description before pickup.\n\n---\n\n### Decision 3 — Playwright e2e placement: `apps/web/e2e/` vs standalone `e2e/` workspace\n\n| Option | Description | Recommendation |\n|---|---|---|\n| `apps/web/e2e/` | Co-located with the app it tests; simpler imports | ✅ **Recommended** for a single frontend app |\n| `e2e/` (root workspace) | Independent package; easier to add multi-app tests later | Choose if multi-app e2e is planned |\n\n**Affects:** item-009, item-016 (CI path configuration).\n**Action:** Record decision in item-009's description before pickup.\n\n---\n\n### Decision 4 — Docker Compose scope: in this release or deferred?\n\nitem-012 is currently tagged `optional`. It requires a working Dockerfile and adds ~2 pts to the final sprint.\n\n| Option | Recommendation |\n|---|---|\n| **Include** — ship it as a convenience for contributors without Aspire | ✅ Recommended if open-source or multi-contributor |\n| **Defer** — treat Aspire as the only local dev path for now | Acceptable for small internal teams |\n\n**Action:** Stakeholder/team lead must decide before Sprint 4 planning.\n\n---\n\n### Decision 5 — One-time developer machine setup\n\nThis is not a backlog item — it is an onboarding prerequisite. Ensure every new contributor runs:\n\n```bash\ndotnet dev-certs https --trust\n```\n\n> Without this, the Aspire dashboard and the API HTTPS endpoint will fail on first launch.\n> This step will be documented in the README (item-013) and in the Getting Started section.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Definition of Ready\n\nEvery item in this backlog satisfies the following criteria before it enters a sprint:\n\n- [x] **Title** is clear and independently understandable\n- [x] **Description** explains the what and why, not the how\n- [x] **Acceptance Criteria** — minimum 3 concrete, testable statements (Given/When/Then or checklist)\n- [x] **Size** is estimated in story points; no item exceeds 8 pts\n- [x] **Dependencies** are listed by ID; no circular dependencies\n- [x] **Priority** reflects foundations-first ordering (lower number = pick up sooner)\n- [x] **Status** is `ready` — the item can be started without further clarification\n- [x] **Tags** categorise the item for filtering (backend, frontend, testing, devops, etc.)\n\n---\n\n## 7. How to Read `backlog.json`\n\nThe backlog is stored as a JSON array in `backlog.json` at the repo root. Each item conforms to this schema:\n\n```jsonc\n{\n  \"id\": \"item-NNN\",           // Unique identifier — never reuse or renumber\n  \"title\": \"...\",             // One-line summary\n  \"description\": \"...\",       // Full context; what and why\n  \"acceptanceCriteria\": [     // Testable checklist; minimum 3 items\n    \"...\"\n  ],\n  \"size\": 2,                  // Story points: 1 (trivial) → 8 (max)\n  \"priority\": 1,              // Pick-up order: 1 = pick first\n  \"status\": \"ready\",          // Lifecycle: ready | in-progress | done | deferred\n  \"tags\": [\"...\"],            // Filter labels (see tag taxonomy below)\n  \"dependencies\": [\"item-NNN\"] // IDs that must be done first; [] = no deps\n}\n```\n\n### Tag taxonomy\n\n| Tag | Meaning |\n|---|---|\n| `backend` | C# / .NET work |\n| `frontend` | React / TypeScript work |\n| `dotnet` | .NET-specific tooling |\n| `testing` | Any test code or harness setup |\n| `dx` | Developer Experience improvement |\n| `architecture` | Structural / pattern decisions |\n| `devops` | CI, Docker, deployment |\n| `monorepo` | Workspace-level concerns |\n| `optional` | Item is desirable but not blocking |\n\n### Updating the backlog\n\n- **Starting an item:** change `\"status\": \"ready\"` → `\"status\": \"in-progress\"`.\n- **Completing an item:** change to `\"status\": \"done\"` — do not delete the item.\n- **Adding a new item:** append to the array; assign the next sequential `item-NNN` ID; set `priority` relative to existing items.\n- **Never renumber existing IDs** — other items reference them in `dependencies`.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Next Steps\n\n### Immediately (before first commit)\n\n1. **Resolve the 5 pre-sprint decisions** (Section 5) — record each outcome in the relevant item's description inside `backlog.json`.\n2. **Confirm item-012 scope** with the team lead — in or out of this release.\n3. **Schedule Sprint 1 planning** — items 001, 002, and 003 are ready to assign right now.\n\n### Sprint 1 kick-off checklist\n\n- [ ] Pre-sprint decisions 1–5 are recorded\n- [ ] GitHub repository is created and all contributors have access\n- [ ] `.NET SDK` (latest LTS), `Node.js` (LTS), `pnpm`, and `Docker Desktop` are installed on all dev machines\n- [ ] `dotnet dev-certs https --trust` has been run on all dev machines\n- [ ] item-001 is assigned and in-progress\n\n### After sprint planning\n\n- Update `\"status\"` fields in `backlog.json` as items move through the workflow.\n- Use `backlog.json` as the single source of truth — keep it in sync with any task-tracker (GitHub Issues, Linear, etc.) if one is adopted.\n- Review the backlog at the end of each sprint; reprioritise or split items as needed.\n- The first pull request should deliver item-001 (monorepo scaffold) and unblock parallel backend + frontend work in Sprint 2.\n\n---\n\n*This summary was generated at the end of the backlog grooming workflow. The authoritative item data is in `backlog.json`.*\n\n---\n\n## Sprint 1 Status\n\n**Status:** ✅ Planned — sprint is locked and items are ready to execute.\n**Planned:** 2026-02-23\n\nSprint 1 has been fully planned. All 5 pre-sprint architectural decisions have been resolved and locked into `backlog.json`. Three items are selected for Sprint 1, totalling 6 effective story points (exactly at capacity).\n\n**Selected items:**\n\n| ID | Title | Points |\n|---|---|---|\n| item-001 | Scaffold monorepo folder structure + root `package.json` | 2 |\n| item-002 | Create SharedKernel C# class library with DDD building blocks | 2 |\n| item-003 | Set up .NET Aspire AppHost and ServiceDefaults | 2 |\n| **Total** | | **6pt** |\n\n**Sprint goal:** Establish the foundational monorepo skeleton, SharedKernel DDD primitives, and .NET Aspire orchestration layer so that every subsequent item has a stable, correctly-placed home and the walking skeleton is ready to receive the API and React frontend.\n\n**Execution order:** item-001 is a hard gate and must merge before item-002 and item-003 start. Once item-001 is on `main`, item-002 and item-003 can be parallelised.\n\n→ See **[SPRINT_1_PLAN.md](./SPRINT_1_PLAN.md)** for the full execution contract, acceptance criteria checklists, machine setup prerequisites, complete backlog roadmap, and risk register.\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771889376700}}

Let me produce the full planning output.\n\n---\n\n# Sprint 1 — Planning Gate: Increment Review & Implementation Plan\n\n## Phase 1: Increment Boundary Confirmation\n\n### Repository Current State\n\nThe working directory currently contains:\n- `.pi/` — agent/skill configuration (tooling metadata, not production code)\n- `backlog.json` — full 16-item backlog, all items `\"status\": \"ready\"`\n- `extensions/` — Pi Chronicle tooling scripts (`chronicle.ts`, `damage-control.ts`, etc.)\n- `GROOMING_SUMMARY.md` — grooming session output\n- `justfile` — task runner configuration\n- `node_modules/` + `package-lock.json` — Pi tooling dependencies\n- `package.json` — Pi tooling package only (name: `adventure-engine`, no workspaces, no pnpm config)\n- `SPRINT_1_PLAN.md` — sprint planning artifact\n\n**Critical finding:** The existing `package.json` is the Pi Chronicle tooling package, **not** the monorepo root package. This is a pre-existing scaffold for the Pi AI tooling, not any production deliverable. The `apps/`, `packages/`, `.gitignore`, `.nvmrc`, `.editorconfig`, `global.json`, `Directory.Build.props`, `Directory.Packages.props`, and `.sln` files **do not yet exist**. The increment starts from effectively a clean slate.\n\n---\n\n### Scope Boundary Validation\n\n**Is the increment correctly bounded?**\n\nChecking against INVEST criteria:\n\n| Criterion | Verdict | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Independent** | ✅ | item-001 has no dependencies; item-002 and item-003 depend only on item-001 (in same sprint) |\n| **Negotiable** | ✅ | Each item has a defined floor (minimum to unblock next sprint) and no scope creep signals |\n| **Valuable** | ✅ | Sprint delivers a buildable, testable .NET solution — a real, runnable walking skeleton |\n| **Estimable** | ✅ | 6 story points, 3 well-defined items, clear acceptance criteria |\n| **Small** | ✅ | No item touches more than 2 distinct system areas; all are 2-point items |\n| **Testable** | ✅ | Concrete DoD: `dotnet build` exits 0, `dotnet test` exits 0, Aspire dashboard runs, `pnpm install` succeeds |\n\n**Are there any scope violations between the sprint plan and the system prompt increment definition?**\n\nOne refinement is present: the system prompt's increment definition is **more specific** than the existing `backlog.json` entries (which were written before Sprint 1 planning locked the details). The system prompt supersedes `backlog.json` for this sprint's acceptance criteria. Specific delta items:\n\n1. **item-002** — System prompt specifies `IDomainEvent` as a plain marker interface (no MediatR), `AggregateRoot` with `AddDomainEvent()`/`ClearDomainEvents()`, `Result<T>` with implicit operators, `Error` with static factory methods (`NotFound`, `Validation`, `Conflict`, `Unexpected`). The backlog.json entry is less specific. **The system prompt spec is the authority.**\n2. **item-002** — System prompt bundles the xUnit test project (`packages/SharedKernel.Tests/`) directly into item-002, whereas `backlog.json` defers that to item-014. **The system prompt's consolidation is correct** for this sprint — item-014 stays in Sprint 2 for the API test project scaffold, but the SharedKernel test project is in-sprint here.\n3. **item-003** — System prompt specifies AppHost `Program.cs` with no services wired yet (no API reference yet — that comes in Sprint 2), and `CONTRIBUTING.md` as a named file with a Prerequisites section. The `SPRINT_1_PLAN.md` mentioned AppHost referencing the API stub — the system prompt correctly removes that requirement (API is Sprint 2's item-004). This is consistent with the constraint \"No API project this sprint.\"\n\nAll three deltas are **tightening or clarifying**, not expanding scope. The increment is correctly bounded.\n\n**Deferred items confirmed out of scope:**\n- No frontend work (item-006 through item-009: Sprint 2+)\n- No API project (item-004: Sprint 2)\n- No xUnit API test project (item-014 API side: Sprint 2)\n- No EF Core, no MediatR, no HTTP clients\n- No Docker Compose (item-012: Sprint 5)\n- No CORS, no CI pipeline, no Storybook\n\n---\n\n### Risks and Assumptions\n\n**Risks identified:**\n\n| # | Risk | Severity | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| R1 | Existing `package.json` conflict | **Medium** | The current `package.json` is the Pi tooling package. The monorepo root package must be created as a new file. The Pi tooling must either be relocated or the root `package.json` must absorb it. Since `node_modules/` and `package-lock.json` are present for Pi tooling with npm (not pnpm), there will be a migration step. |\n| R2 | `.sln` merge conflict during parallel item-002 / item-003 work | Medium | Both items add projects to the same `.sln` file. Second PR must rebase after first merges. Mitigated by sequencing: item-001 creates the `.sln` stub; item-002 adds SharedKernel + SharedKernel.Tests; item-003 adds AppHost + ServiceDefaults. |\n| R3 | `dotnet workload install aspire` not pre-installed | Medium | item-003 requires the Aspire workload. Must be confirmed on the dev machine before starting that item. |\n| R4 | pnpm version conflict with existing `package-lock.json` | Low | Current repo has `package-lock.json` (npm) alongside a bare `package.json`. Switching to pnpm workspaces will replace this with `pnpm-lock.yaml`. The npm lockfile should be deleted during item-001. |\n| R5 | `Directory.Build.props` warnings-as-errors with Aspire SDK | Low | Aspire tooling sometimes emits build warnings. With `TreatWarningsAsErrors` active, these could fail `dotnet build`. May need to suppress specific warning codes. |\n| R6 | Node LTS version for `.nvmrc` | Low | Must confirm current LTS at time of implementation (currently v22.x as of Feb 2026). |\n\n**Assumptions locked:**\n- .NET 9 SDK is the target (per `global.json` requirement and item constraints)\n- pnpm is the package manager (per `pnpm-workspace.yaml` requirement)\n- `apps/` + `packages/` is the folder convention (Decision 1, locked)\n- No MediatR anywhere in this sprint\n- `IDomainEvent` is a plain `interface`, not tied to any messaging library\n- `IRepository<T, TId>` is interface-only, no implementation\n\n---\n\n## ✅ INCREMENT APPROVED FOR PLANNING\n\nThe Sprint 1 increment is correctly bounded, internally consistent, and free of scope violations. All deferred items are explicitly excluded. The acceptance criteria surface below is the single combined DoD for the increment.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Combined Acceptance Criteria Surface (Locked)\n\n### item-001 — Scaffold monorepo folder

(confirm: dotnet --version → 9.0.xxx)\n- pnpm installed (confirm: pnpm --version)\n- Node.js LTS installed (confirm: node --version → v22.x)\n- dotnet workload install aspire (required for item-003)\n- dotnet dev-certs https --trust (one-time per machine)\n```\n\n---\n\n### ITEM-001: Scaffold monorepo folder structure + root `package.json`\n\n**Execution order: Must complete and merge before item-002 or item-003 begin.**\n\n**Step 1 — Clean up Pi tooling collision**\n- Delete `package-lock.json` (npm lockfile — replaced by pnpm)\n- Leave `node_modules/` in `.gitignore`; the Pi tooling in `extensions/` is not a production workspace — leave it as-is but ensure it is not included in pnpm workspace globs\n- Verify `extensions/` is not matched by `apps/*` or `packages/*` workspace globs (it won't be — the globs are specific)\n\n**Step 2 — Create top-level directory structure**\n- Create `apps/` directory (empty, needs a `.gitkeep` if empty)\n- Create `packages/` directory (empty, needs a `.gitkeep` if empty)\n\n**Step 3 — Create root `package.json`**\n- Replace the existing `package.json` content entirely\n- Fields: `name`, `private: true`, `type: module`, `packageManager: pnpm@<current-stable>`, `workspaces: [\"apps/*\", \"packages/*\"]`\n- Scripts: `start`, `test`, `test:e2e`, `test:api`, `storybook`, `build` (all as placeholder `echo` commands or `dotnet`/`pnpm` commands stubbed)\n- Retain or migrate any Pi tooling dependencies if needed (check if `yaml: ^2.8.0` is still needed for the Pi scripts — likely yes; keep it or move it)\n\n**Step 4 — Create `pnpm-workspace.yaml`**\n- Content: `packages: [\"apps/*\", \"packages/*\"]`\n\n**Step 5 — Create `.gitignore`**\n- Node: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.cache/`, `*.log`\n- .NET: `bin/`, `obj/`, `*.user`, `*.suo`, `.vs/`, `TestResults/`\n- Aspire: `.aspire/`\n- Playwright: `playwright-report/`, `test-results/`, `.playwright/`\n- Environment: `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.*.local`\n- JetBrains: `.idea/`, `*.iml`\n- VS Code: `.vscode/` (or selective — keep `.vscode/extensions.json` if desired)\n- macOS: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`\n\n**Step 6 — Create `.nvmrc`**\n- Content: `22` (current Node.js LTS major as of Feb 2026)\n\n**Step 7 — Create `.editorconfig`**\n- Root marker: `root = true`\n- All files: `indent_style = space`, `charset = utf-8`, `trim_trailing_whitespace = true`, `insert_final_newline = true`\n- C# files: `indent_size = 4`\n- JS/TS/JSON/YAML: `indent_size = 2`\n\n**Step 8 — Create `global.json`**\n- Content: `{ \"sdk\": { \"version\": \"9.0.xxx\", \"rollForward\": \"latestMinor\" } }`\n- Pin to the specific .NET 9 SDK version installed on the dev machine\n\n**Step 9 — Create `Directory.Build.props`**\n- Location: repo root (applies to all C# projects in the tree)\n- Properties: `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>`, `<ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>`, `<TreatWarningsAsErrors>true</TreatWarningsAsErrors>`, `<LangVersion>latest</LangVersion>`\n\n**Step 10 — Create `Directory.Packages.props`**\n- Location: repo root\n- Enable CPM: `<ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>true</ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>`\n- Package versions to declare (used in item-002 and item-003):\n  - `xunit` — latest stable\n  - `xunit.runner.visualstudio` — matching version\n  - `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` — latest stable\n  - `FluentAssertions` — latest stable (v6.x or v7.x — check breaking changes)\n  - `NSubstitute` — latest stable\n  - Aspire packages: `Aspire.Hosting.AppHost` SDK (SDK-style, not PackageReference)\n  - OpenTelemetry packages for ServiceDefaults: `OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting`, `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore`, `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http`, `OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol`\n  - `Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience`\n  - `Microsoft.Extensions.ServiceDiscovery`\n  - `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks` (built-in, no package needed for net9.0)\n\n**Step 11 — Create `README.md`**\n- Stub only: project title + one-line description\n- Full README is item-013 (Sprint 5)\n\n**Step 12 — Create `.sln` solution file**\n- Command: `dotnet new sln --name AdventureEngine` (run at repo root)\n- No projects added yet — item-002 and item-003 will add their projects\n\n**Step 13 — Create `CONTRIBUTING.md`**\n- Stub with: folder convention documented (`apps/` = runnable, `packages/` = shared libraries)\n- Prerequisites section with `dotnet dev-certs https --trust` (satisfies item-003 AC and the system prompt DoD)\n- Machine setup steps (mirrors SPRINT_1_PLAN.md Section 7)\n\n**Step 14 — Run `pnpm install`**\n- Verify exits 0\n- Verify `pnpm-lock.yaml` is generated\n- Verify `apps/` and `packages/` workspaces are recognized\n\n**Step 15 — Verify**\n- `pnpm install` exits 0 ✅\n- Directory structure matches `apps/` + `packages/` convention ✅\n- All config files present ✅\n\n---\n\n### ITEM-002: SharedKernel C# class library with DDD building blocks\n\n**Depends on: item-001 merged to main.**\n\n**Step 1 — Create the project**\n- `mkdir packages/SharedKernel`\n- `dotnet new classlib --name SharedKernel --framework net9.0 --output packages/SharedKernel`\n- `dotnet sln add packages/SharedKernel/SharedKernel.csproj`\n- Delete the auto-generated `Class1.cs`\n\n**Step 2 — Project file hardening**\n- Confirm `packages/SharedKernel/SharedKernel.csproj` has no `PackageReference` entries (inherits from `Directory.Build.props`)\n- `Directory.Build.props` handles Nullable, ImplicitUsings, TreatWarningsAsErrors — no need to repeat in csproj\n\n**Step 3 — Implement `IDomainEvent`**\n- File: `packages/SharedKernel/Domain/IDomainEvent.cs`\n- Plain marker interface: `public interface IDomainEvent { }`\n- XML doc comment: \"Marker interface for all domain events. Implement this interface on record types representing something that happened in the domain.\"\n\n**Step 4 — Implement `Entity<TId>`**\n- File: `packages/SharedKernel/Domain/Entity.cs`\n- Abstract class `Entity<TId>` where `TId : notnull`\n- Constructor takes `TId id`, sets `Id` property\n- Override `Equals`: two entities are equal iff same runtime type and same `Id`\n- Override `GetHashCode`: based on `Id`\n- Implement `==` and `!=` operators\n\n**Step 5 — Implement `ValueObject`**\n- File: `packages/SharedKernel/Domain/ValueObject.cs`\n- Abstract class `ValueObject`\n- Abstract method: `protected abstract IEnumerable<object> GetEqualityComponents()`\n- Override `Equals`: structural equality via `GetEqualityComponents().SequenceEqual()`\n- Override `GetHashCode`: aggregate hash from components\n- Implement `==` and `!=` operators\n\n**Step 6 — Implement `AggregateRoot<TId>`**\n- File: `packages/SharedKernel/Domain/AggregateRoot.cs`\n- Abstract class `AggregateRoot<TId> : Entity<TId>` where `TId : notnull`\n- Private `List<IDomainEvent> _domainEvents`\n- Public `IReadOnlyList<IDomainEvent> DomainEvents` (returns `_domainEvents.AsReadOnly()`)\n- `protected void AddDomainEvent(IDomainEvent domainEvent)` — appends to list\n- `public void ClearDomainEvents()` — clears list\n\n**Step 7 — Implement `Error`**\n- File: `packages/SharedKernel/Common/Error.cs`\n- `public sealed record Error(string Code, string Message)`\n- Static factory methods:\n  - `public static Error NotFound(string code, string message) => new(code, message)`\n  - `public static Error Validation(string code, string message) => new(code, message)`\n  - `public static Error Conflict(string code, string message) => new(code, message)`\n  - `public static Error Unexpected(string code, string message) => new(code, message)`\n- Static well-known instance: `public static readonly Error None = new(string.Empty, string.Empty)` (for `Result<T>` Success case)\n\n**Step 8 — Implement `Result<T>`**\n- File: `packages/SharedKernel/Common/Result.cs`\n- `public sealed class Result<T>`\n- Private constructor\n- Private fields: `T? _value`, `Error _error`, `bool _isSuccess`\n- Static factory: `public static Result<T> Success(T value)` — sets `_isSuccess = true`, `_value = value`, `_error = Error.None`\n- Static factory: `public static Result<T> Failure(Error error)` — sets `_isSuccess = false`, `_error = error`\n- Properties: `public bool IsSuccess`, `public bool IsFailure => !IsSuccess`, `public T Value` (throws `InvalidOperationException` if failure — defensive guard, not control flow), `public Error Error` (throws if success)\n- Implicit operators: `public static implicit operator Result<T>(T value) => Success(value)`, `public static implicit operator Result<T>(Error error) => Failure(error)`\n- **No exceptions used for control flow** — exceptions only in defensive `Value`/`Error` property guards\n\n**Step 9 — Implement `IRepository<T, TId>`**\n- File: `packages/SharedKernel/Domain/IRepository.cs`\n- `public interface IRepository<T, TId> where T : AggregateRoot<TId> where TId : notnull`\n- Methods: `Task<T?> GetByIdAsync(TId id, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)`, `Task AddAsync(T entity, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)`, `Task UpdateAsync(T entity, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)`, `Task DeleteAsync(T entity, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)`, `Task<int> SaveChangesAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)`\n\n**Step 10 — Verify SharedKernel builds**\n- `dotnet build packages/SharedKernel/SharedKernel.csproj`\n- Must exit 0 with zero warnings, zero errors\n\n**Step 11 — Create SharedKernel.Tests project**\n- `mkdir packages/SharedKernel.Tests`\n- `dotnet new xunit --name SharedKernel.Tests --framework net9.0 --output packages/SharedKernel.Tests`\n- `dotnet sln add packages/SharedKernel.Tests/SharedKernel.Tests.csproj`\n- Add PackageReferences (versions from `Directory.Packages.props`): `FluentAssertions`, `NSubstitute`\n- Add `ProjectReference` to `packages/SharedKernel/SharedKernel.csproj`\n- Delete auto-generated `UnitTest1.cs`\n\n**Step 12 — Write Entity equality tests**\n- File: `packages/SharedKernel.Tests/Domain/EntityTests.cs`\n- Concrete test entity: `private class TestEntity(Guid id) : Entity<Guid>(id)`\n- Test: two entities with same Id → `Equals` returns true, `==` returns true\n- Test: two entities with different Id → `Equals` returns false, `!=` returns true\n- Test: entity equals itself → true\n- Test: entity not equal to null → false\n\n**Step 13 — Write ValueObject equality tests**\n- File: `packages/SharedKernel.Tests/Domain/ValueObjectTests.cs`\n- Concrete test value object: `private record MoneyComponents(decimal Amount, string Currency) : ValueObject { override GetEqualityComponents() => [Amount, Currency] }`\n- Test: two VOs with same components → equal\n- Test: two VOs with different components → not equal\n\n**Step 14 — Write AggregateRoot domain event lifecycle tests**\n- File: `packages/SharedKernel.Tests/Domain/AggregateRootTests.cs`\n- Concrete test aggregate and test domain event\n- Test: `DomainEvents` is empty on new aggregate\n- Test: `AddDomainEvent` appends event, `DomainEvents.Count` = 1\n- Test: `AddDomainEvent` twice → `DomainEvents.Count` = 2\n- Test: `ClearDomainEvents` resets list to empty\n\n**Step 15 — Write Result<T> tests**\n- File: `packages/SharedKernel.Tests/Common/ResultTests.cs`\n- Test: `Result<T>.Success(value)` → `IsSuccess = true`, `Value = value`\n- Test: `Result<T>.Failure(error)` → `IsSuccess = false`, `IsFailure = true`, `Error = error`\n- Test: implicit operator from `T` → produces success result\n- Test: implicit operator from `Error` → produces failure result\n- Test: accessing `Value` on a failure result → throws `InvalidOperationException`\n\n**Step 16 — Write Error factory tests**\n- File: `packages/SharedKernel.Tests/Common/ErrorTests.cs`\n- Test: `Error.NotFound(\"code\", \"msg\")` → `Code = \"code\"`, `Message = \"msg\"`\n- Test: `Error.Validation(...)`, `Error.Conflict(...)`, `Error.Unexpected(...)` — each produces a non-null `Error` record\n\n**Step 17 — Run all tests**\n- `dotnet test` from repo root\n- Must exit 0, all tests green\n\n---\n\n### ITEM-003: .NET Aspire AppHost + ServiceDefaults\n\n**Depends on: item-001 merged to main. Can run in parallel with item-002.**\n\n**Step 1 — Verify Aspire workload**\n- `dotnet workload list` — confirm `aspire` is installed\n- If not: `dotnet workload install aspire`\n\n**Step 2 — Create ServiceDefaults project**\n- `mkdir packages/ServiceDefaults`\n- `dotnet new classlib --name ServiceDefaults --framework net9.0 --output packages/ServiceDefaults`\n- `dotnet sln add packages/ServiceDefaults/ServiceDefaults.csproj`\n- Delete auto-generated `Class1.cs`\n\n**Step 3 — Configure ServiceDefaults project file**\n- Add PackageReferences (from `Directory.Packages.props`):\n  - `Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Resilience`\n  - `Microsoft.Extensions.ServiceDiscovery`\n  - `OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting`\n  - `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore`\n  - `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http`\n  - `OpenTelemetry.Exporter.OpenTelemetryProtocol`\n  - `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks` (if not already in framework)\n- Note: These are the same packages emitted by `dotnet new aspire-servicedefaults`. Consider using that template instead of `classlib` to get the canonical scaffold.\n\n**Step 4 — Implement `AddServiceDefaults()` extension**\n- File: `packages/ServiceDefaults/Extensions.cs`\n- Extension method on `IHostApplicationBuilder`:\n  - Configure OpenTelemetry with traces (AspNetCore, HttpClient), metrics (AspNetCore, HttpClient, Runtime), logs\n  - Add OTLP exporter (reads from `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` env var — Aspire injects this automatically)\n  - Add resilience: `builder.Services.AddHttpClient()` + `AddStandardResilienceHandler()`\n  - Add service discovery: `builder.Services.AddServiceDiscovery()`\n- **Recommended alternative:** Use `dotnet new aspire-servicedefaults --output packages/ServiceDefaults` — this generates the canonical Aspire ServiceDefaults scaffold with all the correct extensions pre-wired. If using this template, remove generated placeholder files and verify it matches requirements.\n\n**Step 5 — Implement `MapDefaultEndpoints()` extension**\n- Extension method on `WebApplication`:\n  - Map `/health` → live health check (`builder.MapHealthChecks(\"/health\")`)\n  - Map `/health/ready` → ready health check with `HealthCheckOptions { Predicate = r => r.Tags.Contains(\"ready\") }`\n- Only map endpoints in Development environment (use `app.Environment.IsDevelopment()` guard or always expose — Aspire dashboard needs both)\n\n**Step 6 — Create AppHost project**\n- `mkdir apps/AppHost`\n- `dotnet new aspire-apphost --name AppHost --output apps/AppHost`\n- **Or** manually: `dotnet new classlib` then change SDK in csproj to `Aspire.Hosting.AppHost`\n- `dotnet sln add apps/AppHost/AppHost.csproj`\n\n**Step 7 — Configure AppHost project file**\n- SDK: `<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">`\n- `<Sdk Name=\"Aspire.AppHost.Sdk\" Version=\"x.x.x\" />` (version from workload)\n- `<TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>`\n- ProjectReference to ServiceDefaults: `<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\packages\\ServiceDefaults\\ServiceDefaults.csproj\" />`\n- `<IsAspireHost>true</IsAspireHost>`\n\n**Step 8 — Write AppHost `Program.cs`**\n- File: `apps/AppHost/Program.cs`\n- Minimal content:\n  ```csharp\n  var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n  // No services wired yet — API project added in Sprint 2 (item-004)\n  builder.Build().Run();\n  ```\n- XML comment documenting the dev-certs prerequisite\n\n**Step 9 — Update `CONTRIBUTING.md`**\n- Add Prerequisites section if not already present (item-001 should have created the stub)\n- Add:\n  ```\n  ## Prerequisites\n  ...\n  dotnet dev-certs https --trust\n  ```\n- Run `dotnet dev-certs https --trust` on the implementing developer's machine and verify the Aspire dashboard loads without HTTPS errors\n\n**Step 10 — Verify full solution build**\n- `dotnet build` from repo root\n- Must exit 0, zero warnings, zero errors\n\n**Step 11 — Verify Aspire dashboard**\n- `dotnet run --project apps/AppHost`\n- Aspire dashboard must open at `http://localhost:15888` (or documented port) without errors\n- No HTTPS certificate errors in browser\n\n**Step 12 — Final solution-level test**\n- `dotnet test` from repo root\n- All SharedKernel.Tests must pass\n- Exit code 0\n\n---\n\n### Post-Sprint Verification Checklist\n\nRun these from the repo root after all three items are merged to `main`:\n\n```bash\n# 1. Workspace install\npnpm install\n# Expected: exits 0, pnpm-lock.yaml present, workspaces apps/* and packages/* recognized\n\n# 2. Full solution build\ndotnet build\n# Expected: exits 0, zero warnings, zero errors\n\n# 3. Full test run\ndotnet test\n# Expected: exits 0, all SharedKernel.Tests pass\n\n# 4. Aspire dashboard\ndotnet run --project apps/AppHost\n# Expected: dashboard at http://localhost:15888, no errors\n\n# 5. Verify no compiler warnings\ndotnet build --verbosity normal 2>&1 | grep -i warning\n# Expected: no output (TreatWarningsAsErrors ensures any warning would have already failed step 2)\n```\n\n---\n\n### File Creation Summary\n\n| File/Directory | Item | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| `apps/` | 001 | Empty directory, `.gitkeep` |\n| `packages/` | 001 | Empty directory, `.gitkeep` |\n| `package.json` | 001 | Replace existing Pi tooling package — migrate `yaml` dep if still needed |\n| `pnpm-workspace.yaml` | 001 | New file |\n| `.gitignore` | 001 | New file — comprehensive coverage |\n| `.nvmrc` | 001 | New file — `22` |\n| `.editorconfig` | 001 | New file |\n| `global.json` | 001 | New file — pins .NET 9 SDK |\n| `Directory.Build.props` | 001 | New file — shared MSBuild props |\n| `Directory.Packages.props` | 001 | New file — CPM versions |\n| `README.md` | 001 | Stub — replace existing if any |\n| `AdventureEngine.sln` | 001 | `dotnet new sln` |\n| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | 001/003 | Created in 001, Prerequisites added in 003 |\n| `packages/SharedKernel/SharedKernel.csproj` | 002 | `dotnet new classlib` |\n| `packages/SharedKernel/Domain/IDomainEvent.cs` | 002 | |\n| `packages/SharedKernel/Domain/Entity.cs` | 002 | |\n| `packages/SharedKernel/Domain/ValueObject.cs` | 002 | |\n| `packages/SharedKernel/Domain/AggregateRoot.cs` | 002 | |\n| `packages/SharedKernel/Domain/IRepository.cs` | 002 | |\n| `packages/SharedKernel/Common/Error.cs` | 002 | |\n| `packages/SharedKernel/Common/Result.cs` | 002 | |\n| `packages/SharedKernel.Tests/SharedKernel.Tests.csproj` | 002 | `dotnet new xunit` |\n| `packages/SharedKernel.Tests/Domain/EntityTests.cs` | 002 | |\n| `packages/SharedKernel.Tests/Domain/ValueObjectTests.cs` | 002 | |\n| `packages/SharedKernel.Tests/Domain/AggregateRootTests.cs` | 002 | |\n| `packages/SharedKernel.Tests/Common/ResultTests.cs` | 002 | |\n| `packages/SharedKernel.Tests/Common/ErrorTests.cs` | 002 | |\n| `packages/ServiceDefaults/ServiceDefaults.csproj` | 003 | `dotnet new aspire-servicedefaults` recommended |\n| `packages/ServiceDefaults/Extensions.cs` | 003 | `AddServiceDefaults()` + `MapDefaultEndpoints()` |\n| `apps/AppHost/AppHost.csproj` | 003 | `dotnet new aspire-apphost` |\n| `apps/AppHost/Program.cs` | 003 | Minimal bootstrap |\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n### What was accomplished\n- Confirmed the Sprint 1 increment is **correctly bounded** against the existing codebase (empty slate aside from Pi tooling infrastructure)\n- Validated all three in-sprint items against INVEST criteria — all pass\n- Identified the single most important implementation risk: the existing `package.json` is a Pi tooling artifact that must be cleanly replaced/migrated without breaking `.pi/` tooling\n- Reconciled the delta between `backlog.json` acceptance criteria (looser, written pre-planning) and the system prompt increment definition (authoritative, post-planning) — the system prompt wins on all deltas\n- Confirmed `SharedKernel.Tests` is correctly in-sprint with item-002 (not deferred to item-014), as item-014's scope in Sprint 2 will be the API test project only\n- Confirmed AppHost has **no API reference** this sprint (clean break from `SPRINT_1_PLAN.md` which mentioned an API stub reference — the system prompt correctly removes this)\n\n### Key findings\n1. **Package.json collision**: `package.json` already exists as Pi tooling. item-001 must replace it. The `yaml: ^2.8.0` dependency may need to be retained or the Pi tooling migrated to its own package under `extensions/`.\n2. **`.sln` file naming**: Will be `AdventureEngine.sln` — both item-002 and item-003 add projects to it, requiring sequential PR merges or rebase discipline.\n3. **Aspire template recommendation**: Using `dotnet new aspire-servicedefaults` and `dotnet new aspire-apphost` is strongly preferred over manual project creation — these templates emit the exact canonical scaffold, including correct SDK references, package versions, and extension signatures.\n4. **`Directory.Packages.props` must be complete before item-002/003**: All NuGet package versions must be declared before test and Aspire projects are created, or builds will fail with CPM version-missing errors.\n5. **No MediatR constraint is clean**: `IDomainEvent` is a plain interface with no external dependency — this is the correct design.\n\n### Files created or modified\nNone — this is a planning-only output. No files were modified.\n\n### Recommendations for the builder\n1. **Start with `Directory.Packages.props`** within item-001 — populate it completely before item-002 or item-003 begin. A missing version entry with CPM enabled causes a hard build failure.\n2. **Use the Aspire templates** (`dotnet new aspire-servicedefaults`, `dotnet new aspire-apphost`) rather than manual project creation. The templates are the official scaffold and include the correct Aspire SDK declarations and package versions that match the installed workload.\n3. **Merge item-001 before cutting branches for item-002/003.** The `.sln` file is a hard conflict point — whoever merges second must rebase and re-run `dotnet sln add`.\n4. **Validate `TreatWarningsAsErrors` compatibility with the Aspire SDK** early in item-003. If the Aspire templates emit any nullable or obsolete warnings, they must be suppressed with `<NoWarn>` rather than disabling the global setting.\n5. **Delete `package-lock.json`** as the first action in item-001 — it signals npm was used and will confuse contributors if left alongside `pnpm-lock.yaml`.\n\n### Blockers\nNone. The increment is approved. All architectural decisions are locked. The sprint is ready to execute.\n\n---\n\n**SPRINT 1 INCREMENT: ✅ APPROVED FOR PLANNING**\n*Acceptance criteria surface locked as documented above. Implementation may begin with item-001.*"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"github-copilot","model":"claude-sonnet-4.6","usage":{"input":1,"output":10277,"cacheRead":22856,"cacheWrite":270,"totalTokens":33404,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1771889384416}}
