  "currentStateTask": "User request to incorporate into backlog grooming: \"Add hard CI perf budgets (startup/CI/storybook timings) as strict pass/fail gates.\"\n\nPlease update and review the backlog in .pi/chronicle/backlog.json accordingly.\n\nSpecific instructions:\n1) Ensure this requirement is represented as properly-sized backlog items (split if oversized) with clear acceptance criteria.\n2) Include explicit performance budget thresholds for:\n   - application startup timing\n   - CI pipeline timing\n   - Storybook timing\n   If exact numbers are unknown, create a discovery/spike item ahead of implementation, but keep the implementation items testable and bounded.\n3) Make pass/fail gating explicit (CI must fail when budget is exceeded).\n4) Add dependencies/order so prerequisite instrumentation/baselining comes before enforcing gates.\n5) Re-check backlog health: item sizing, acceptance criteria completeness, dependencies, and priority order.\n6) Write all changes back to .pi/chronicle/backlog.json and return a concise review of what changed and what is now ready.\n\nAssume this is high priority due to build reliability and feedback-loop impact.",
